# NumberGuesser
by Andreas Wisofschi

This porgram will generate a RANDOM number between 1 and N (the user input bein N), and the user will attempt to guess that number.
After rach attempt the program will tell the user if it is too high or too low.
It will continue this loop until the user has guessed the correct number, and it will display the amount of turns taken.
